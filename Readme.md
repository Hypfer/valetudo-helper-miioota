valetudo-helper-miioota is a small utility that can be used to install rooted firmwares onto some older robots.

Those being:
- Roborock S5 (non Max!!)
- Roborock V1 also known as the Xiaomi Mi Robot Vacuum (made before 2020-03)

It comes as a single binary with no additional dependencies and requires only experience with a terminal.

Simply download the latest binary [from the releases section](https://github.com/Hypfer/valetudo-helper-miioota/releases)
and execute it in a terminal/powershell window.



## Valetudo helpers

Valetudo helpers are a series of small standalone self-contained single-purpose single-file tools built to make
usage and/or installation of Valetudo a bit easier.

As with everything Valetudo, some intermediate computer skills are required. You should know what a network is,
what HTTP is, how a terminal works and that kind of stuff.
Please understand that it's not feasible for this or any open source project to provide basic computer lessons.
